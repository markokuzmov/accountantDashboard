# Accountant Dashboard

## MVP Idea:

Web-Based dashboard that uses the Quickbooks API, ProSeries data (exported or scraped), and potentially Trello to show the "health status" of clients. 

Client Data:
 - Name
 - Taxes done? (idk)
 - whatever else


This data will be stored in a database (most likely SQLite to start, maybe switch to mySQL or postgreSQL later).

The backend will be built using Flask in python, with an API-style JSON return format that I can then use to build a React frontend.

**That's the plan**
